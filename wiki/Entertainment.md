## Introduction

The home's entertainment system is designed to be controlled by the web interface and is designed to cater to the user's experience by allowing the user to set automatic light dimming when a movie is played on the TV.

Additional options allow the user to set house's door bell and home phone to a lower volume to allow the user to have an uninterrupted experience. The system may also allow for the door bell or phone to be set to a higher volume to allow the user to hear it when playing a loud movie.

A layout of the living room is displayed in a bird's eye view, to allow for audio balancing.
