## Introduction

Hello, we are a group of computer science students consisting of Anthony Wu, David Lin, Nathan Dorman, and Michael Fujimoto.
Our enrollment in Software Engineering has given us the opportunity to work with Team Hawaii 2011, a group who will be participating in the 2011 Solar Decathlon.


## Our Goal
Our goal is to create a simple and easy to use interface to be used in a solar powered home.
We feel that energy efficiency and a user-friendly interface can be achieved through our work.
Ultimately, we would love for Team Hawaii 2011 to choose our design and have the opportunity implement our system in a real home.
