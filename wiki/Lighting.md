## Introduction

The lighting page allows users to control any of the lights in the home. Options available to the user maximize efficiency by allowing the user to adjust the brightness of the lights, as well as have presets for cloudy days.

The lighting page also controls the aim of each light to let the user make best of lights that may set to a brightness lower than 100%.
