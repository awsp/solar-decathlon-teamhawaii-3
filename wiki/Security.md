## Introduction

The security system of the home is complemented by both video and thermal cameras that cover every room. Though these cameras are used in motion detection to provide efficient lighting, these cameras may also double as a surveillance system when a digital video recording system is installed.

Mobile alerts can be issued via text messaging or email whenever the home's alarm is set off. These alerts can be modified, or set to a schedule.

The home is outfitted with lights that can activate with motion to ward off intruders. This can be toggled on and off from this menu.

Since every room has a camera, a live feed can be vied over the internet for a home owner. This can be used in situations where the owner may have thought they left the front door ajar, video chat with an occupant of the house, or just wants to check out their aquaponics tank.
