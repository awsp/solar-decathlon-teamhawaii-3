## Introduction

The water page gives the user a more in-depth overview of the home's water usage than the home page's water statistics. The water page has an emphasis on cost to encourage efficiency. The user is presented with a weekly timeline of the amount of gallons used per day and tells the user how many gallons of hot water are allocated.

The water page also allows the user to activate the outdoor sprinkler system, and will give the user tips or suggestions on usage if it is not an optimal time to water the yard, or the hot water allocation is running low due to wasteful water usage.
