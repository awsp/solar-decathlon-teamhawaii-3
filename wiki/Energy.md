## Introduction

The energy page allows the user to monitor energy consumption by showing a profile layout of the entire home.

If a particular room is consuming an unusually high amount of energy, the user can be alerted from the home page, and when navigating to the energy page, the room/zone will use a color coded display to show the user which room is consuming too energy, and potentially a suggestion on how to be more energy efficient.
