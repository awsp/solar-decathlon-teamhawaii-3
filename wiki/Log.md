## Introduction
The log page gives users access two main functions: 1) viewing critical/maintenance/system messages from the home's automated system, and 2) allowing users to leave messages to other users.

The reason system messages are displayed here is because the user is more likely to read, and take action upon, a message that is displayed with user-to-user messages as opposed to having a different page with system-only messages that users are more likely to ignore.

In addition to seeing messages from other users in the home, the user can have urgent (or all) emails integrated into the log screen from an external email address.
