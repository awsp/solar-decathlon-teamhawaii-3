## Introduction
Because settings for each subsystem are specific to their subpages, the settings page of the web interface allows the user to save their user information, as well as set phone numbers and email addresses that can be used for mobile alerts.

Additional users can also be added to the system via the settings page. A list of users can be accessed to remove users, or modify access restrictions (for guests, children, non-admins).

Owners can log in to the web interface remotely over the internet to monitor the home's systems.
