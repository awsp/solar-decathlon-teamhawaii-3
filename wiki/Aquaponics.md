## Introduction

The aquaponics page gives the user detailed readings of gas content of the system, including: oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide.

A timeline of the pH levels in the tank are also displayed to allow the user to detect any strange activity in the tank that would require attention.

The status of the tank is displayed in readable text and if any action is required, the user can be alerted from the home screen, and presented with a suggestion of what do adjust to correct any problems with aquaponics system.

Note that these controls are for the advanced user, and have the ability to be adjusted remotely by a professional using the same interface.
